# Point-of-Sale-Web-Application


A simple, browser-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system - a web app for managing products, inventory and sales (billing / receipts).
This README is written so you can quickly run the project locally, understand its capabilities, and contribute.

---

# What is this project?

A web POS application built with a Python web framework (Django/Flask style structure is used here - the repo contains `manage.py`, `templates/`, and `static/`). It provides the typical features a small retail/business needs: product & inventory management, a checkout/sales interface, invoices/receipts and admin views.

---

# Features

* User authentication (admin/cashier roles typical)
* Product CRUD (create/read/update/delete)
* Inventory / stock management
* Sales / billing / checkout interface
* Invoice / receipt generation (printable)
* Dashboard / basic sales summary and reports
* Static frontend assets (HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript)

> NOTE: Exact features present depend on the repository’s implemented modules. The above list reflects the common features and what is usually present in this repo structure.

---

# Tech stack (expected)

* Python 3.8+
* Django (likely) or Flask (structure suggests Django because of `manage.py`)
* SQLite (dev) or another relational DB for production
* HTML/CSS/JS for frontend (`templates/`, `static/`)

---

# Quick start — run locally (copy this into your terminal)

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone https://github.com/sonali6062/Point-of-Sale-Web-Application.git
cd Point-of-Sale-Web-Application

# 2. create and activate virtualenv
python -m venv venv
# mac / linux
source venv/bin/activate
# windows (powershell)
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# windows (cmd)
# venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. install dependencies
# if requirements.txt exists:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# if there is no requirements file, install Django and common libs
pip install django pillow djangorestframework

# 4. database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# 5. create superuser (admin)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 6. run the dev server
python manage.py runserver

# open in browser:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/    -> app
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ -> Django admin (if Django)
```

---

# If something’s missing

* **No `requirements.txt`?** create one after you confirm working packages:

  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
* **`manage.py` missing or not a Django project?** Inspect `README.md` or project root for start instructions. If it’s Flask, look for `app.py` or `wsgi.py`.
* **Errors running `migrate`**: Make sure `DATABASES` in settings points to a valid DB. For quick dev use `sqlite3` (default Django DB).
* **Missing static/media files**: Some images or assets may be tracked externally. Check `static/` and `media/` folders.

# Environment variables (example `.env`)

If the project uses an environment file, create `.env` and add values similar to:

```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
```

(Adapt names to what `settings.py` or the config expects.)

---

# Default credentials (if any)

If the repository includes a fixture or a default created user, check `/fixtures` or `initial_data`. Otherwise, use `createsuperuser` to create an admin.

---

# Suggested folder overview

```
Point-of-Sale-Web-Application/
├─ manage.py
├─ requirements.txt
├─ POS/ or pos_app/        # main app(s)
├─ templates/              # HTML templates
├─ static/                 # CSS/JS/images

# Common commands

* Run server: `python manage.py runserver`
* Create migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations`
* Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
* Create admin: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Load fixtures: `python manage.py loaddata <fixture_file.json>`

# How to contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Add tests / update docs
4. Open a Pull Request with description of changes

---

# Troubleshooting tips

* `ModuleNotFoundError`: `pip install <missing-package>` or check `requirements.txt`
* Static files not loading: run `python manage.py collectstatic` (if project uses that) and ensure `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` configured for production.
* Concurrent stock updates: production systems should use DB transactions and optimistic locking to prevent race conditions during checkout.

If some module is missing (ModuleNotFoundError), install it manually, e.g.:
---
pip install djangorestframework
pip install pillow


If database issues -> delete the db.sqlite3 file (if it exists), then re-run migrations.

Check if the repo has any README.md instructions (sometimes specific steps are mentioned).
